# ESP32 Turbidity Sensor Particle Sensor Project

### Project Overview
The ESP32 Turbidity Sensor Particle Sensor project demonstrates how to interface a turbidity sensor with an ESP32 microcontroller to measure the turbidity or cloudiness of water. This project is useful in water quality monitoring applications, where it is important to detect the presence of suspended particles in the water.

### Components Needed
- **ESP32 Microcontroller**: Used to read the turbidity sensor input.
- **Turbidity Sensor**: Measures the cloudiness of water by detecting the amount of light scattered by suspended particles.
- **Jumper Wires**: Connect the turbidity sensor to the ESP32.
- **Breadboard**: Optional, for organizing circuit connections if needed.

### Circuit Setup
1. **Connecting the Turbidity Sensor to ESP32:**
   - **Turbidity Sensor Pin**: Connect the output pin of the turbidity sensor to an analog input pin on the ESP32 (e.g., GPIO 34).

### Instructions
1. **Setup:**
   - Initialize Serial communication using `Serial.begin(9600)` for debugging purposes.
   - No need to set pinMode for analog pins, as they are automatically configured.

2. **Operation:**
   - **Reading Turbidity Value:**
     - Use `analogRead(turbiditySensorPin)` to read the analog value from the turbidity sensor.
     - Print the turbidity value to the Serial Monitor.
   - **Detecting Water Quality:**
     - Compare the turbidity value against a defined threshold (`turbidityThreshold`).
     - Print "Water is dirty!" if the turbidity value is above the threshold.
     - Print "Water is clean." if the turbidity value is below the threshold.

3. **Output:**
   - Continuously display the turbidity value.
   - Indicate water quality based on the threshold.

4. **Considerations:**
   - **Threshold Adjustment:** Adjust the `turbidityThreshold` value based on your specific environment and sensor calibration.
   - **Sensor Calibration:** Calibrate the sensor to ensure accurate turbidity measurements.
   - **Environment:** Test the sensor in the intended environment to ensure reliable operation.

### Applications
- **Water Quality Monitoring:** Detect turbidity in water for environmental and industrial applications.
- **Aquarium Maintenance:** Monitor water clarity in aquariums.
- **Agricultural Systems:** Ensure clean water for irrigation and livestock.
